# Breast-cancer-definition-classification
This repository contains a comprehensive study on breast cancer classification using various machine learning algorithms, including decision trees, kernel SVM, logistic regression, Naive Bayes, random forests, and support vector machines. The project includes data preprocessing, model training, evaluation, and performance comparison.

* Decision_tree_classification Accuracy Score = 0.959

* K_nearest_neighbors Accuracy Score = 0.947

* Logistic_regression Accuracy Score = 0.947

* Naive_bayes Accuracy Score = 0.9415

* Random_forest_classification Accuracy Score = 0.935

* Support_vector_machine Accuracy Score = 0.9415

<b>So the best model is Decision_tree_classification</b>
